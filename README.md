# dotfiles

```sh
$ ln -ns <path-to-this-repo>/emacs.d  ~/.emacs.d
```

## Notes

* python mode
* at least version 24 so can use package manager
* use your palm for meta/c keys
* projectile is cool but maybe expendable
* jedi is awesome (py code completion)
* recentf (from http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/04/05/recently-visited-files/)
* flycheck
  * `pip install pylint`, `pip install flake8`
    * use `M-x flycheck-verify-setup` to check it's set up correctly

## To do

* Look at magit emacs plugin
* cask
* ctags-exuberant?
* code completion for js
